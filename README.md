# tetris-react
Tetris using react.js instead of vanilla js
Adding in accounts and leaderboards hopefully before presentation day.

My inspiration for making this app came from the first thing I ever did with any development which was work on a .js based video game to host online. This whole class I havent created anything like a game so knowing I was doing the project alone I thought what better way to brush up on some skills like react.js while making a game I can enjoy as I do actually find the original tetris to be a fun little time passer which is why I kept the oldschool scoring model as well as a retro like design. I've enjoyed playing my own tetrius which feels good. However, I was under the impresssion we would submit this after presentation like our other projects but I just saw Alpers slack so I'm going to push what I have over to heroku now. However I would like to keep working on it before presentation so I can meet the all reqs. I will say though this project has really been my favorite assignment I just hope I am allowed to make last minute changes. To add my features and update this README.md  


or nevermind then. guess not. 
don't think i can make it out of this one. 
dont know what to do now, another project, assigmentds, idk?
